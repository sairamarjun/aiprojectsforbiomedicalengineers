# AI Projects For Biomedical Engineers
the codes displayed in these are mostly relaed to biomedical fields. these projects used AI concepts applied in the medical field. Most of the projects involve binary or multiclass classificstion. the code includes the conversion of code into a temporary website.
# first project- medical instrument classification
this project is an image detector. it classifies the given image as one of the most common 20 classes of biomedical equipments. there are two types of instruments namely diagnostic (used to detect something) and therapeutic (used to treat something).
the dataset has about 40 images per class in training set and about 5 images per class in testing set.
we have used VGG-16 model for the image detection.
the model has produced 1.8 loss function and 93% accuracy. providing more images can reduce the loss function
the web developed from it allows the user to take image from camera and upload in the case of mobiles
the web developed from it allows the use to take image from local storage and upload in the case of computers
